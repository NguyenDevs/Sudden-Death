#SETTINGS FOR BLOOD SCREEN EFFECT

#  default (Default) - The fading occurs equal to the amount of time set by the variable interval.
#  health - Fading occurs depending on the interval and the value of the remaining health of the player.
#           The lower the health of the player, the longer and more pronounced the effect.
#  damage - Fading occurs depending on the interval and the damage received by the player.
#           The more damage the player received, the longer and more pronounced the effect.
mode: default

# The fading time for the player.
# Default value: 6 (~2 seconds)
interval: 6

# The coefficient of speed with which the animation (fake distance) decreases at the edges.

# Accepts a value in decimal fraction from 0.1 to 0.9 inclusive.
# Values greater than or equal to one are not accepted.

# Default value: 0.95
