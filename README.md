##**New mechanics!**
- Bleeding: players can start bleeding anytime when taking damage! Bleeding deals damage on time and can be stopped using a Bandage.
- Infection: a zombie attack can cause an Infection to a player. He will slowly lose life and see strong halucinations (confusion and strange background noises). Infection can be stopped using a Strange Brew.
Rare hardcore events
During a Bloodmoon, only zombies with Speed, Resistance and Strength will spawn. Players take additional damage and are slowed when taking damage. A bloodmoon has a small chance to appear when night arrives.
Thunderstorm: lightning bolts randomly appear around players. Lightning bolts deal additional AoE damage and knockback. A thunderstorm has a small chance to appear when a regular storm begins.

##**New monsters**
Undead Gunners, zombies shooting exploding rockets at players!
Bone Wizards, skeletons that can summon firebolts and ice curses to kill players.

Custom mob system
You can create custom monsters with configurable stats and spawn chance! This system is not as complete as a full mob solution like MythicMobs (e.g there's no option for drops), however if you don't want to spend hours on configuring mobs, you may try the custom mob system from SuddenDeath. Here is the list of the mob attributes you can edit:
Attack Damage (1.9+)
Maximum Health
Movement Speed (1.9+)
Right & Left Hands
Equipment
Display Name
Enchantments & leather armor colors for equiped items
Spawn Chance
Potion Effects

##**5 Custom Difficulties**
Players can select among the 5 different difficulties the one that fits the most their playstyle! Difficulties increase damage taken by all sources and reduce the players' max health. The difficulties are:
Sandbox (100% damage, 20 max health)
Difficult
Hardcore
Death Wish
Sudden Death (200% damage, 10 max health): players with no armor get annihilated by a stone sword attack.


##**Extra features**
Cool particle & sound effects for every ability
All non-admin messages & GUIs can be translated
WorldGuard flags
Full tab completion system
