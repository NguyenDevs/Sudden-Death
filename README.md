## New Mechanics!
- **Bleeding**: Players can start bleeding anytime when taking damage! Bleeding deals damage over time and can be stopped using a Bandage.
- **Infection**: A zombie attack can cause an Infection to a player. He will slowly lose life and see strong hallucinations (confusion and strange background noises). Infection can be stopped using a Strange Brew.
- **Rare Hardcore Events**:
  - **Bloodmoon**: During a Bloodmoon, only zombies with Speed, Resistance, and Strength will spawn. Players take additional damage and are slowed when taking damage. A bloodmoon has a small chance to appear when night arrives.
  - **Thunderstorm**: Lightning bolts randomly appear around players. Lightning bolts deal additional AoE damage and knockback. A thunderstorm has a small chance to appear when a regular storm begins.

## New Monsters
- **Undead Gunners**: Zombies shooting exploding rockets at players!
- **Bone Wizards**: Skeletons that can summon firebolts and ice curses to kill players.

    - Attack Damage (1.9+)
    - Maximum Health
    - Movement Speed (1.9+)
    - Right & Left Hands Equipment
